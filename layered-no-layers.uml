Blockchain --> Bob : confirmed
note across: height = Tbob
Bob -> Blockchain : post refund tx
note across: height = Tbob + confirm_delay
Blockchain --> Bob : confirmed

== Alice wants to expire the htlc ==

note across: height = Talice - to_self_delay - confirm_delay - grace
Alice -> Bob: drop_htlc(R, Talice)
Bob -> Alice: ack

hnote across #aqua
Note, Bob must set

Tbob < Talice - (to_self_delay + 2*confirm_delay + grace)

in order to know his funds are reclaimed from Carol
prior to sending the ack to Alice.
end note
